CarbonArmv6 Source for ARMv6 and other Legacy Devices
Getting Started

To get started with the Carbon-Dev sources, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.

Create the Directories

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

To create them run:

mkdir -p ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/carbon
Install the Repository

Enter the following to download make executable the "repo" binary:

curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo

chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. Now enter the following to initialize the repository:

cd ~/carbon
Repositories:

Before you continue --> run this in the terminal

repo init -u https://github.com/CarbonArmv6/android.git -b cm10.2

repo sync -f
PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST USE THE -f flag when repo syncing/initializing if you want to sync with our default -j4 setup as android.googlesource seems to like to reject your requests if you set your -jflag too high. if you wish to avoid this issue run it repo sync -j1 otherwise -f (force) is reccomended so it will resync the repos it gets error codes on. Thank you and have a nice day.

Building the System

    sh vendor/cm/get-prebuilts

Build your device:

    source build/envsetup.sh
    brunch DEVICENAME (for ex: brunch cooper)

Flash ZIP:

    out/target/product/DEVICENAME/cm-VERSION-DEVICENAME.zip


Please see the [CyanogenMod Wiki](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/) for building instructions.
